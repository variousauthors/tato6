Hey! The plan here is to update Roots to 3.1

To do this you need to first update to 3.0.35

Do not forget to do this on the server!!!

## Recovering Context
 - the patchouli changes are just documentation for the roots/thaumcraft changes
   so release them when you release roots 3.1

 - I think for now I will just update Roots to 3.0.35
   can do the next update in the next update
   - the reason we need to update roots is so that my cool thaumcraft scripts will work
     see scripts/thaumcraft-plants
   - remember to check that the world-gen is not too terribly affected
   - changes in bread and roots seem to be just for compat with the new versions of things
     - I think I remember... they added a new parameter for the name of the recipe or something

 - I need to check whether my zenUtils script for mystcraft ink is working
   the liquid handler code I added is in 1.9.8 and I'm not sure if that version
   is actually up on the server (the server has 1.9.7 listed, but I wonder if I
   maybe built a jar with my changes and pushed that up...)
