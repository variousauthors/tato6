## [Unreleased]

## Added

 - Fork of Nature's Compass, you can use the compass to track down rare biomes but it isn't easy!

## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-09

### Added

 - Alluvial aluminium ore with a weight of 4 just for fun because I love gravel ore
 - Unidict mod and dependencies (instantunify, wanionlib) to experiment with automatic unification
 - Tinker's JEI to help players who want to do Tinker's
 - Appleskin to display saturation of food items in the UI
 - Mystical Mechanics and Mystical Gears to complement Embers (I didn't realize how important these were)
 - Blockcraftery as a substitution for Carpenter's so that I can have my secret doors...
 - Sentek's Runic Teleporters as a poor man's waystones or "cheap, dangerous teleportation"
 - Thermal Expansion and deps (codechicken lib) to form the basis of tech and automation
 - Arcane Archives and Simple Storage Network to help organize our rediculous modded inventories
 - Improved Backpacks as an elegant diagetic personal storage device
 - A CHANGELOG based on keepchangelog.com to help me keep track of things
 - Thermal Dynamics because it got pipes

### Changed

 - Alluvial gravel ore's min spawn height to 0 so that everyone can enjoy gravel ore
 - Vanilla gravel's min spawn height from 0 to 80, to eliminate overlap with alluvial ore
 - Salt ore cluster count from 8 to 4 to make it a little more rare
 - Alluvial tin ore weight from 160 to 80 because there was just so. much. tin.
 - Alluvial gold ore weight from 1 to 2 to make it a little less rare
 - Embers ruins spawn weight from 0 to 5 because it was accidentally set to 0 ;)
 - Roots mortar can now be used to pulvarize ores, coal, etc... (but it doesn't double the ores)

## Removed

 - Mystical world's book from the player's starting inventory
 - Tinker's Construct's book from the player's starting inventory
 - Mystical world's ore dusts because we get ore dusts from thermal foundation
 - Mystical world's tiny dusts... what are those!?
 - Quark's chance to spawn Guardians in deep ocean biomes, nobody needs that
