setChunkGeneratorDefinition:
    Arguments:
        ChunkGeneratorDefinition
    Usage:
        definition
    Notes:
        Sets the ChunkGeneratorDefinition for the dimension to the provided one.

setChunkGeneratorScript:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        script name
    Notes:
        Sets the ChunkGenerator script.

setChunkGeneratorType:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        ChunkProvider type
    Notes:
        Used to set the ChunkGenerator type. Type options are "SURFACE", "FLAT", "HELL", "END", "VOID", "SKY_ISLANDS"

setBiomeProviderSingle:
    Arguments:
        Non_Null_Biome_ID
    Usage:
        biome ID
    Notes:
        Sets the dimension to use the "SINGLE" BiomeProvider type and sets the biome as the provided biome ID.

setBiomeProvider:
    Arguments:
        String, String

        script name, BiomeProvider type
    Notes:
        Used to set the BiomeProvider script and BiomeProvider type. Neither option may be null. Type options are "SURFACE", "SINGLE", "CUSTOM_LIGHT", "CUSTOM_MEDIUM"

addBlockReplacement:
    Arguments:
        String, String
    Usage:
        script name, BlockReplacement type
    Notes:
        Used to add a BlockReplacement script of the provided type. Type options are "Simple"

addBlockReplacement:
    Notes:
        Adds a BlockReplacement to the dimension and returns it, so functions can be run on it. The same functions that can be called in a blockreplacement script, can be called on this object. Documentation can be found in documentation/blockreplacements

addBlockReplacement:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        BlockReplacement type
    Notes:
        Adds a BlockReplacement to the dimension with the provided type, and returns it, so functions can be run on it. Type options are "Simple". The same functions that can be called in a blockreplacement script, can be called on this object. Documentation can be found in documentation/blockreplacements

setChunkGenerator:
    Arguments:
